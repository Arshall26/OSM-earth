# OSM-Earth Presentation

Let's make the following assumptions:

Everyone knows Google Earth and the possibility offered to navigate in 3D on the surface of the
planet.

Everyone knows the maps of the IGN (National Geographic Institute) called topographic on
which one can get a fairly precise idea of ​​the relief, in particular thanks to the level curves.

Finally, everyone knows the free mapping project OpenStreetMap (OSM).

The goal of this project is to offer a 3D visualization (like GoogleEarth does) of a portion of territory,
but to replace the natural textures with tiles extracted from OpenStreetMap highlighted using
information from an elevation model (DEM for Digital Elevation Model). In other words, we
wants to achieve virtual 3D maps, analogous to raised maps made of molded plastic
sold by IGN.
